# ðŸ’¥ Nest ðŸ”° Webpack ðŸ”° Docker ðŸ’¥

This repo is a starting point for others who wish to build a [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) app with minimal footprint. Bundling dependencies with Webpack, and containerized for Docker.

| production build of `main.js` "Hello World!"                                    | 1.49MB |
| Containerized as a Docker image [node:12-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) | 81.9MB |

The Alpine variant of Node.js' Docker base image is being used for minimal footprint.

Produced from a fresh `nest new` command, using [nest-cli](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages), with minimal modification. Currently there are some intricacies to bundling dependencies for a Nest app. Please refer to: [Issue: #1706](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/issues/1706) For clarification, comments are included in the `Dockerfile` and `webpack.config.json`.

The following packages were added to the default `package.json` produced from the `nest new` CLI command.

```
webpack
webpack-cli
tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin
```

Also 3 new scripts have been introduced into the `package.json`

```bash
# Bundle with webpack
npm run build:prod

# Build the docker image
npm run docker:build

# Run the docker image
npm run docker:run
```

For containerization, ensure your app is using the port from the environment if it exists.

**"main.ts"**

```ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  // For Docker containerization
  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
  await app.listen(PORT);

  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
}
bootstrap();
```
